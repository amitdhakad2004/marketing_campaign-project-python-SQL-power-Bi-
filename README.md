Data Analyst project (marketing_campaign (python, SQL , power Bi) )
Project Objective
The objective of this portfolio is to conduct an end-to-end marketing campaign performance analysis using three core tools—Python (Pandas), SQL, and Power BI—to enable actionable, data-driven decision-making in digital marketing.

This involves:

Cleaning and transforming raw marketing data to prepare it for analysis.

Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key behavioral patterns in user engagement, channel performance, and cost-return efficiency.

Using SQL queries to slice and segment the data by audience demographics, geography, campaign type, and channel to evaluate metrics such as CTR, ROI, CPC, CPA, and Conversion Rate.

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize real-time KPIs and trends across platforms (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Email).

Applying advanced techniques like window functions, rank-based filtering, and time intelligence to reveal high-performing strategies.

Providing insights and optimization recommendations to guide campaign planning, budget reallocation, and content targeting.

Ultimately, the goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and marketing strategy—delivering clear, actionable insights that can enhance conversion rates, reduce wasted ad spend, and improve return on investment across all digital channels.
